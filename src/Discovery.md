
Disclosure, discovery, and monitors
===================================


> Disclosure, discovery and inspection are crucial to dispute resolution. Transparency is integral to the perception of fair treatment, which perception underlies acceptability of Agreements and Judgments.


> This part draws on “Part V - Investigation and prosecution” of the ICC statute.


> The Tribunal may have an official monitor, or set of official monitors, that include the IMF and World Bank, or any other monitor that may be chosen by the Tribunal.



Appointment of a Monitor
------------------------


> Monitors are delegates of the Tribunal whose position serves to collect information, provide advice to states and creditors, facilitate negotiations, attend depositions. The monitor is in effect a statutory amicus curae.


> As a creature peculiar to insolvency law, there is no precedent in international law for a monitor.


> The Monitor proposed here is intended to serve as the primary motivator and a “catch-all” that subsumes all creditors not represented by a Creditor Committee.


> The only provision for protecting minority creditor rights at the moment is through a willing Monitor.


1. The Tribunal shall engage the services of a Monitor within ten days after a declaration.


> A Monitor may be a human or a organization, but in any case should have appropriate expertise. The IMF may be the preferred and even automatic choice of Monitor. This Treaty ought to work well and integrate into the existing framework.


2. The Monitor shall have the power to:


    a. Collect and examine evidence;


    b. Request the presence of and question persons which direct knowledge and information of the dispute;


    c. Request a written report from and presence of individuals with expertise relevant to disputed issues;


    d. Seek the co-operation of any State or intergovernmental organization or arrangement in accordance with its respective competence and/or mandate;


    e. Enter into such arrangements or agreements, not inconsistent with this Treaty, as may be necessary to facilitate the cooperation of a State, intergovernmental organization or person;


    f. Take necessary measures, or request that necessary measures be taken, to ensure the confidentiality of information, the protection and preservation of evidence.


> The above is from the ICC article 54. It may be unnecessary.
