
Determinations
==============


> This section sets out the tools to:


> 1. Identify issues for adjudication;


> 2. Attempt to resolve issues in advance of adjudication, including work-outs for classes of creditors;


> 3. Issue orders and directions to advance negotiations, including demands for discovery and disclosure;


> 4. Ensure that no party is delaying resolution without adequate justification;


> 5. Set a matter down for a hearing.


> A consensual work-out is often going to be preferable to a hearing and a “cram down”, and the Treaty and Rules should facilitate that outcome.


Reference
---------


The Tribunal may bring a reference of any dispute or any severable component of any dispute to a state’s highest court within the State of the choice of law set out in the Rules, and the Tribunal shall be bound to the opinion of that court.


> The idea here is that the tribunal would ask a national tribunal for an opinion on a point of national law.
Proposals
---------


> Prior to being accepted by creditor vote and the debtor, a Proposal is an “Offer”.


> The Rules shall have to deal with voting on Offers.


1. Any party with standing may advance a Proposal to resolve any disputes before the Tribunal.


2. A Proposal is enforceable:


    a. As a Judgment of the Tribunal after approval by the Tribunal; or


    b. As a contract where agreed to unanimously by all Participating Creditors.


3. Such proposals shall be submitted to the Tribunal and made temporarily irrevocable, as set out in the Rules, for not more than 7 days.


> Deeming proposals irrevocable for a short period of time is common in domestic insolvency regimes.
Limitations on Proposals
------------------------


Unless otherwise specified in the Rules, a Proposal is invalid:


a. To the extent that it increases or imposes the liabilities of a Creditor without its consent;


> “Increases” probably includes “imposes”, in cases where there are no prior liabilities; it is better to be explicit about this.


b. If it is grossly unfair as between creditors or creditor classes;


c. If it is manifestly contrary to public policy in the jurisdiction of the choice of law or violates the principles of fundamental justice.


> The above is from Article 4 on page 29 of the Interim Report of the Sovereign Insolvency Study Group.


> The public policy may be that of the debtor, the lex loci contractus, or the jurisdiction of the choice of law.
Remedies
--------


> The powers of the Court to grant a remedy, i.e. the remedial jurisdiction, are those set out below. A remedy may not be enforceable unless it falls within this jurisdiction.


The terms that may be incorporated into a Judgment include:


1. A waiver;


2. change of terms of agreements including payment terms;


3. an exchange;


4. a cancellation;


5. priority to any creditors providing new credit;


6. any other arrangement without limitation affecting claims.


> See Article 3 of the Interim Report.


> There are other powers that may be of use (but perhaps are better left as voluntary or another institution), such as:


> - netting out and set-off of liabilities and assets;


> - creation of a currency and amortization of any previous obligations in a floating currency of a state;


> - the use of a central counterparty; and


> - pass-through (assignment of sovereign debts to the sovereign’s constituents).


> An open question is whether the Court should be given an open-ended remedial jurisdiction, such as “any order that is just”
