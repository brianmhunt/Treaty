Disclaimer: This work is not a completed or approved document endorsed by the officers or members of the Sovereign Insolvency Study Group. The composition of any related or derivative work of the SISG may differ significantly from this document.


> This document contains a proposal for a treaty that may be enacted by states to create a mechanism that permits sovereign states to restructure their debts. This proposal builds on the “Option C” in Sovereign Insolvency Study Group ‘State insolvency: options for the way forward’ in the International Law Association Report of the Seventy-Fourth Conference (The Hague 2010) (International Law Association, London 2011) 978 (at pages 31ff) (which report of the study group will be referred to in this document as the "Interim Report"). The terms of Option C from the Interim Report are incorporated and referred to below.


> This document is arranged as an annotated Statute of law for state signatories. Grey italicized text is an annotation on the body text. This document will be referred to in this document as the “Treaty”, and the tribunal created by the Treaty that may determine disputes between states in financial distress and their creditors will be referred to in the comments as the “Tribunal”.


> The objective of this work is to illuminate a credible model for embodying, and illustrating in that model, those principles that are in the opinion of the study group applicable to the restructuring of public sovereign debt. The study group is not advocating this work as necessarily the only solution, but rather a piece for discussion that illuminates the principles legal experts have put forward as important issues for discussion.


> Where differing opinions have been put forth, this work seeks to incorporate them either directly or in comments. Some alternatives proposed by members of the study group are equally as viable as the options chosen for incorporation into this work, and this work should not be considered the end of a discussion on a viable orderly sovereign bankruptcy regime, but the beginning.


>  This proposal represents a deviation from the basic principle of ‘pacta sunt servanda’, being the premise that states must be held accountable for their promises. This deviation is based upon the policy rationale that the strict enforcement of debt obligations on a state often results in significant negative repercussions (wastage and unfairness) that can be mitigated by imposing upon parties to the debts a system for disclosure, negotiation of resolution, and a fallback to a binding determination through an impartial tribunal. This deviation from the strict adherence to contractual obligation is commonly referred to as “bankruptcy”.


> The essential features of this regime are:


> * The binding of all parties by treaty to either:
>     + a work-out through a majority vote by creditors;
>     + a determination by an independent and impartial permanent tribunal.
> * A Declaration Instructions where debtors may indicate:
>     + the instruments involved;
>     + any pre-conditionality for re-financing;
>     + the mechanism for account and distribution of assets;
> * Priority re-financing (akin to “debtor-in-possession”)
> * An independent monitor with investigative powers;
> * Voluntary activation by a state debtor;
> * Investigative powers of discovery and disclosure;
> * An administrative body that acts as a quasi-legislative/regulatory body and can make and change the rules of procedure


> The regime for financial administration shall encourage expediency, certainty, finality, fairness, and principled resolution. As detailed in the Interim Report, there is no regime for an orderly restructuring of sovereign debt at present. The respective benefits that constitute the “core bargain” of this proposal are as follows:


> **Debtors**:

> 1. A temporary stay on litigation and execution (thereby avoiding a grab race and asset hiding)


> 2. Refinancing with priority (debtor-in-possession) over existing debt (reducing refinancing costs and increasing the return to growth and financing)


> 3. A binding final decision over creditor classes (eliminating hold outs and vultures)


> 4. Apolitical, independent conflict resolution (reducing geopolitical tension and the perception of unfairness)


> 5. A baseline as an alternative to negotiations (expediting growth and market financing)


> **Creditors**:

> 1. A predictable process and body of jurisprudence (increasing the speed of a work-out)


> 2. The perception of fairness as between creditor classes (reducing unnecessary acrimony and mistrust)


> 3. Expedient determinations (avoiding wastage)


> 4. Symmetry of information and access to discovery rules (increasing the perception of fairness to a work-out)


> 5. A final and binding determination (eliminating uncertainty)


> 6. Debtors will have less of an incentive (and, practically speaking, less opportunity) to drive down the value of their bonds


> **Non-participants**:


> 1. Reduce inter-state acrimony and ensuing fallout


> 2. Greater market efficiency because the onus for burden of credit assessment shared between debtor and creditor


> 3. Reduction of bankruptcy-to-rule (sovereign credit as a tool of foreign diplomacy)


> 4. Recognition of equality among state debtors

> 5. Avoidance of state-as-gatekeepers for foreign debts


> There are sacrifices in exchange for the benefits of a regime such as this. Debtors shall give up sovereignty and by signing a treaty they acknowledge the possibility of an insolvency. Creditors lose the ability to hold out for a better deal.


> The objectives of the regime are akin to domestic bankruptcy, namely to reduce wastage (especially due to delay) and increase the fair treatment as between creditors and of the debtor.


> The proposed tribunal operates on the basis of two primary instruments and an ancillary document: a treaty that creates the institutional foundations, functions and powers of the tribunal,  and a set of rules that dictate the procedure, and a “Declaration Instructions” that permits states to prescribe a position leading into a possible work-out in advance. These documents would be created as follows:


> * Treaty / Amendment to Articles: State agreement and ratification


> * Rules of procedure: Administrative body for the Tribunal


> * Declaration Instructions for a state: Filing by the State with the Tribunal




> This treaty draws upon the experience of eight international dispute settlement mechanisms. The commentary refers to clauses in their constituent instruments which this Treaty relies upon for inspiration.


> Of all the dispute settlement mechanisms, the WTO may be particularly relevant because of the modicum of political control, with the Dispute Settlement Body being an organization with representatives of the state parties.

> A treaty has been chosen as the mechanism for illuminating how one may codify the principles of sovereign bankruptcy because of the relative clarity and concision available. Perhaps the most challenging practical issue is that for any mechanism to be effective the United States must almost certainly ratify the instrument. There are a number of mechanisms that may serve in the place of a treaty (e.g. model law, amending articles of the IMF or UN, contract, and bilateral treaties); these alternatives are beyond the scope of this document.


> This document draws upon the language of the above treaties because they have been negotiated at length by the same stakeholders who would be considering this instrument.


> The practicability of the tribunal rests in large part with the mechanism chosen. Functionally, an amendment to the IMF and UN Articles are equivalent to that of a treaty, and such an amendment automatically binds the signatories of the IMF and UN respectively.


> Amendment of the IMF Articles requires approval of the US Congress, whereas amendment of the UN Articles requires ***?***. Alternatively, the President of the United States may form and negotiate a treaty, but the treaty must be advised and consented to by a two-thirds vote in the Senate.


> Insofar as debt is predominantly regional, the most practicable option may be regional treaties that have reciprocity agreements with other tribunals.


> As far as it may be possible, this treaty is meant to be implementation-agnostic, and ideally represent the application of principles that would apply in any bankruptcy regime.



### Introduction


The Tribunal provides facilities for mediation and adjudication of disputes between signatory states and its creditors.


> Though the applicable rules may vary, it is envisioned that the Tribunal shall appoint a mediator in those cases where the parties cannot agree on one. The mediator shall not be a judge of the Tribunal.


The Tribunal Rules are comprised of


1. Rules of Procedure; and


2. The Declaration Instructions of each signatory state.
