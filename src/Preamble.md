### Preamble


The States Parties to this Convention,

**Acknowledge** that all states potentially run the risk of insolvency, and that such risk requires techniques for resolution;


> Acknowledgment that state insolvency is a perennial problem, which may arise with or without fault on behalf of debtors or creditors, and may affect states in any region of the world.


**Mindful** of the uncertainty and costs that are associated with delaying a resolution between a state debtor in financial difficulties and its creditors;


**Cognizant** that structured process and a final binding determination of disputes between debtor states and their creditors:


1. Reduces harm to states in financial distress, their constituents, other states and creditors of the states, by


    a. Maintaining confidence by creditors and investors in the state's ability to meet its debt obligations and in financial stability;


    > Confidence is really the currency of financial stability, at least in a fiat system. Preserving that confidence across financial markets is a key of this treaty.


    b. Upholding civil and social order and the institutions of the debtor state;


    c. Maintain the state's essential services to its citizens and residents;


    d. Reduces the aggregate loss to creditors;


    > The financial administration regime shall limit the time in which states remain insolvent, which reduces the time in which fear, uncertainty and doubt may spread; the regime also provides a baseline for negotiation for voluntary negotiations between the state and its creditors.


    > Delay in a resolution increases uncertainty and may have a negative effect on the aggregate losses to creditors, particular if there is contagion.


    e. Serves the goal of the peaceful settlement of all disputes;


    > Under the UN Charter, and the earlier the Drago-Porter Convention, state defaults can only be settled by peaceful means, which rule is furthered by this Treaty.


    f. Provides an impartial and independent forum for adjudicating disputes arising out of sovereign debt and ensuring the equal treatment as between creditors and debtor states


    > At present some creditors can be preferentially repaid, and there is the potential for unequal treatment, as between creditors, and as between different states in similar situations. Unequal treatment undermines confidence in the debt restructuring process and international governance.


**Understand** that the principles of insolvency have been incorporated into the laws of almost all states for individuals and corporations, and that some of these principles of insolvency may be applied to states, mutatis mutandis, to form a regime to facilitate organized resolution of states in financial distress


> Insolvency has achieved significant success for individuals and corporations in domestic law, and elements of such regimes can be extrapolated to states.


**Accept that** uniform principles may require tailoring to the individual circumstances of each state;


> This is the reason why this Treaty relies default rules ("Model Rules"), which for the most part may be modified by the Declaration Instructions published by each state, or grouping of states, as the case may be.


**Agree** upon the following:
