
General principles of sovereign bankruptcy
==========================================


> The following set the framework for a judgment and a baseline for a negotiated resolution. This mirrors Part III of the Rome Treaty, “general principles of criminal law”, and sets out the relevant principles to be considered in negotiations and in judgments. There is an argument these should be in the preamble, or alternatively language so they have operation.


> The Powers of the Tribunal ought to be limited to execution in accordance with these principles - the furtherance of the objectives of financial administration.


Limits on Acts of State
-----------------------


> This article is meant to prevent states from creating laws or entering other agreements that undermine the operation of this Treaty. It also defines a scope within which Judgments must be construed.


Except insofar as they may advance principles set out in this part, the following shall not impugn the application of this treaty:


a. Any Direction;


b. Any amendments to the Model Rules;


c. Any Rules;


d. Any existing or future contractual agreements;


e. Any existing or future domestic state law;


f. Any existing bilateral or multilateral treaty;


g. Any other existing or future instrument otherwise binding as between the State and any Creditors.


> Note that it’s important that this section does not undermine, and is not intended to prejudice, relationships such as secured credit, creditor classes and debtor-in-possession style refinancing priorities.


Expeditiousness
---------------


The Tribunal shall operate with all due haste so as to minimize uncertainty and prolonged harm.


> This should refer to a Timetable in the Rules, like with the WTO DSU.


Equal treatment
---------------


Creditors within a Class shall be treated pari passu.


> This Article should discuss how classes are defined (by whom, basis, etc.)


National Treatment
------------------


No domestic Creditor shall receive treatment preferential to that of any other Creditor who is not domestic.


> It is an open question whether this should be limited to Judgments or consensual restructurings.


> Prior experience with the SDRM suggests that more headway will be had by limiting the imposition of the tribunal to the role of a mediator and facilitator. However, it is a fundamental principle of justice that the presence of a fallback to a trusted arbitration process that may result in a binding decision shall expedite negotiations.


No Preference Between Classes
-----------------------------


No Class shall be given treatment preferential to another Class except as one may have a priority over the other as set out in the Rules.


> Principles may be set out here or in the Rules with respect to priorities, within the bounds of which the Rules may modify.


Stay on creditor execution
--------------------------


> Stays prevent unfair outcomes by preventing a grab race and an unfair seizure of assets by individual creditors before a Debtor enters financial administration.


1. A debtor state may by public notice stay all creditor executions in respect of plan claims for a period not more than 90 consecutive days in any one year. The stay is binding on all holders of plan claims and shall be treated as binding by the courts of each member state.


2. A member state may not stay creditor executions unless all the following are fulfilled:


    a. the member state is unable to pay its plan claims as they fall due or is likely to be unable to pay them as they fall due


    b. the member state has disclosed to the holders of plan claims a statement setting out details of plan claims and a proposal as to how the plan claims and other claims to be restructured should be dealt with, as well as details of claims which will not be restructured, and


    c. more than 50 per cent by nominal principal amount of the holders of plan claims have approved the stay.


> This stay only stays the seizure of assets. It does not stay accelerations of loans or bonds, the commencement of litigation for unpaid amounts, obtaining judgement or litigation generally.


Voidable Preference
-------------------


1. A voidable priority means a preferential payment that has been granted preference as the result of a transaction. A party whose benefits may be reduced as a result of the transaction may ask the Tribunal to annul the priority.


> Where a priority is voidable, any party may ask the Court to put them in the position they would have been in had the transaction not been entered into.


> Voidable priority in this context does not include secured transactions.


2. Any priority shall be voidable where that priority deprives creditors of equal and fair treatment and:


a. arises out of an act by the Debtor less than  one year prior to a declaration pursuant to this Convention; or


b. arises out of an intentional act of state that was intended to avoid obligations to creditors.


> The above is designed to undo unjust preferences.


> If preferable priorities are not voidable, there shall always be a grab-race for preferences when any hint of possible financial administration is given. This is a serious contraindication of both avoidance of default and orderly recovery. It creates unfairness, distorts the market, and can unduly burden the debtor.


> If preferences can be voided, the benefit of the grab race is undone and therefore rendered pointless.


Valuation
---------


The Rules may specify how differing currencies shall be redenominated for the purpose of calculating benefits.


> A process for normalizing the values ought to be in the Rules. This process may also be specified in the Declaration Instructions.


Creditor majority interests
---------------------------


An Agreement may be binding between all Creditors or a Class of Creditors and shall be binding only upon the consent of the Debtor and Majority of all Creditors or respective Class.


> This Convention ought not to permit a minority of creditors to determine the outcome of a proceeding.


> Note: minority interests do require protections; they may be protected by equal treatment and most-favoured class clauses, as well as transparency.


Preservation of contracts
-------------------------


The Tribunal shall preserve terms of contract except and only insofar as those terms are inconsistent with the principles set out in this section.


> This article is meant to endow the tribunal with the principle of minimal interference in ongoing relationships and promises for future performance.


Publication of awards
---------------------


The Tribunal shall publish awards, and Judges shall provide a full and reasoned statement for any awards they make and findings on the evidence and conclusions.


Creditor Conflicts
------------------


> This provision is meant to permit the Rules to oblige creditors to disclose interests that may conflict with the interests of the state


The Rules may provide that, and the extent to which, a creditor is obliged to disclose any benefits that they may become entitled to, which benefits encourage the creditor to refuse to enter into an Agreement.


> What shall be the consequences of finding a conflict? e.g. Shall the creditor be disentitled to vote?
