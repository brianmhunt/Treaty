> Open questions on appeal include:


> 1. what constitutes the panel for an appeal;


> 2. the powers on appeal (mandamus, certiorai, receiving evidence, etc.)


> 3. the standard of appeal (manifest incorrect facts, error of law,  etc.)


> 4. the effect of decisions on appeal - binding on future decisions (stare decisis) or persuasive
