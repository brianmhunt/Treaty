===========================


> This part lays the institutional foundations for the Tribunal's operations


Establishment
-------------


The International Tribunal for State Financial Administration is hereby established.


The objective of the Tribunal shall be to facilitate the orderly restructuring of the financial obligations of states during periods of fiscal hardship by


1. relieving short-term obligations by way of a temporary stay on litigation over financial instruments against the debtor,


2. facilitating open and honest communication and disclosure in good faith between stakeholders,


3. providing an enforceable mechanism for binding all creditors by way of a vote of the majority;


4. providing a fallback to a binding determination on the merits by an impartial an independent panel of arbiters.


> Once the judges have been appointed the Tribunal shall be constituted, which procedure shall fall under the Rules.


Definitions
-----------


In this Treaty, and applicable Rules,


“Administration”
:    refers to the process of the Tribunal commenced as of the date of Declaration and ending on the date of a judgment that has not been appealed within the prescribed period for appealing the judgment.


> Appeals are discussed further below.


“Agreement”
:    refers to a Proposal that has been approved by the Tribunal, and has the same force and effect as a Judgment.




“Creditor”
:    refers to a person with title to Debt;


> The definition of a “creditor” should be perfectly congruent with the definition of “debt”. It is noteworthy that derivatives may cloud the question of title versus beneficiary.


“Class”
:    refers to a set of Creditors who have common factual or legal interests that may be resolved together, as set out in the Declaration Instructions;


> Division of creditors into classes can facilitate negotiations by aligning similar interests. Valid classes may be bondholders with a given priority, distinct legal issues, similar payment terms, common currency, or any other factors that may distinguish their interests from that of the balance of creditors.


> For voting purposes, classes are mutually exclusive.


“Debt”
:    refers to a sum of a calculable amount payable by a debtor state in respect of a liquidated money demand, recoverable according to the legal process of the law chosen law by a debtor state in its Declaration Instructions or otherwise by agreement, as well as any other obligations of the debtor state that are specified as Debt in the Declaration Instructions;


> The question of what is “debt” is non-trivial, and was deliberated at length by the authors of the SDRM.


> This treaty should include all financial obligations of the debtor state, subject to the specific exceptions set out below. Such exclusions may be (without limitation):


> 1. Sovereign-sovereign debt;


> 2. Payments of ongoing concerns;


> 3. Foreign direct investment;


> There is a question as to whether “domestic” and “foreign” debt can be defined and ought to be treated differently. The distinction between domestic and foreign debt can be the choice of law (domestic or foreign), choice of currency, or another distinction. This distinction may also be left to the debtor to set out in its Declaration Instructions.


> An open question is whether the principal of some or all debt shall be accelerated.


> A state should not be able to change the definition of “debt” in its Declaration Instructions to create unjust preferences. There are a number of ways to protect against this possibility, including a “financial equivalence” clause (i.e. no debt should be excluded that is financially equivalent to a debt that is included in the restructuring) and a “debt” definition in the Rules that cannot be undone by Declaration Instructions. Creditors and debtors both have incentives to exclude debts, but this would undermine the comprehensiveness of the tribunal.


> The above being said, the Declaration Instructions could be used to expand the definition of debt to e.g. future foreign direct investments. It would be unfair to creditors for this inclusion to have retroactive application.


“Debtor” and “Debtor State”
:    refers to a state that has filed a Declaration;




“Declaration” and “Declare”
:    refer to the process under this Treaty whereby a state may commence a proceeding;


> There is a live question as to whether it is better to respect sovereignty or permit creditors to commence the process (especially official creditors). It is a difficult question, particularly given the importance of avoiding wastage to delay, and that creditors will typically be inclined to engage the process only where they foresee greater losses from apathetic, pertinacious, or refractory debtors.


“Judgment”
:    refers to a determination of the Tribunal pursuant to this Treaty;


“Declaration Instructions”:
:    refers to the terms adopted by each state party and filed with the Tribunal through the process for filing Declaration Instructionss;
> At any given point in time a state may or may not have a Declaration Instructions. The purpose of the Declaration Instructions is to provide a published document and structure for, without limitation:


> 1. the process of netting out liabilities;


> 2. creating any intermediaries, such as a central counter-party;


> 3. limiting the contagion between the financial sector and the public fiscal sector;


> 4. setting out “pre-conditionality”, being draft legislation that in conjunction with the IMF the state has been agreed upon as a condition of a financial rescue package (and which comes into force at Declaration or a subsequent event);


> 5. the engagement of any other interstate regimes, eg the European System of Financial Supervisors;


> 6. defining certain aspects of the restructuring, including, without limitation:


>    a. the quorum and constitution of a “Majority” of creditors;


>    b. division of classes (distinguishing between “domestic” and “foreign” debts);


> 7. setting objective criteria for the when the state would file a Declaration.


> Note that although the term “Declaration Instructions” mirrors the term arising out of US legislation, it was developed independently for this treaty - and the objectives are similar, so we have adopted that term from US legislation.


“Majority”
:   refers to Creditors numbering more than 2/3 by value, or Creditors in a Class numbering more than 2/3 by value, or as may be set out in the Rules.


> As a key operative provision it may not be prudent to give states too many degrees of freedom in their Declaration Instructions, otherwise the regime becomes unworkable. It is probably preferable to go with a single percentage for all states.


“Member State”
:    refers to a state party to this Treaty;


“Parties”
:    means a Member State and a Majority of Creditors;


“Proposal”
:    refers to a set of terms resolving all disputes between creditors and the debtor, which terms have been agreed to by a Majority and the Debtor;


> A proposal is an Agreement that has not been approved by the Tribunal.


> The proposal is more than resolving a particular dispute, but rather a comprehensive plan for restructuring the state’s debt, including fiscal adjustment (expenditure cuts, tax increases), debt relief by creditors etc.


> This provision should be clear on what the precise role of the Tribunal is in the overall restructuring regime. It may desirable for the treaty not to narrowly focus just on the operation of the Tribunal, which is just a small part of the solution. The treaty should provide a more comprehensive framework for debt restructuring (including the substantive rules that apply to any restructuring, such as NT set out later on in the Treaty).


“Rules”
:    refers to the set of procedural rules as may be established by the Tribunal pursuant to the Treaty


> The Rules are rules of procedure established by the Judicial Council and the Assembly.


“Tribunal”
:    refers to the tribunal created by this Treaty;




Seats
-----


> The tribunal is a permanent system of at least one seat. There may be multiple seats in different parts of the world, to engender the Tribunal with geographical access and regional cultural considerations.


1. The Tribunal shall be established with a secretariat in such state and on such terms as set out in the Rules.


> It may become too complicated to have several seats, especially in view of the small number of cases that they tribunal would hear. For that reason, eg ISDA does not seem to be the best model for this tribunal.


> Choosing a seat in a developing country, stable, small and neutral may be ideal. Singapore or Iceland may be a good compromises.


> Sample clauses for this include Article 3 ICC.


> There is some advantage to multiple concurrent locations, as they could lead to a diversity of perspective, competition in ideas, and an improved discourse on the topic.


2. The Tribunal shall enter into a headquarters agreement with the host States, to be approved by the Assembly of States Parties and thereafter concluded by the President of the Tribunal on its behalf.


> The above is from Article three of the ICC.


3. The Tribunal may sit elsewhere, whenever it considers it desirable, as provided in this statute.


> Ibid.


4. The Tribunal and its members (including employees and agents) shall be immune from prosecution and civil lawsuit in all States Parties for any actions taken in the furtherance of the objectives of the Tribunal.


> The above probably ought to be clarified.
