Jurisdiction
============


> Jurisdiction in the context of this treaty is the delegation of power to the tribunal to


> 1. determine a dispute by way of an award (subject-matter);


> 2. engage institutions of state members to enforce awards (enforcement);


> 3. Compel witnesses to testify and other persons to produce documents (discovery); and


> 4. Recognize decisions of the Tribunal as final (res judicata).


Jurisdiction to bind parties
----------------------------


> It is a matter for debate whether jurisdiction ought to be exclusive.


> Arguments in favour of **exclusive** jurisdiction of the Tribunal:


> 1. It eliminates forum shopping;


> 2. A body of jurisprudence would develop, increasing certainty and consistency;


> 3. There would be no dispute over what forum has jurisdiction.


> Arguments in favour of **non-exclusive** jurisdiction:


> 1. The Tribunal would have an incentive to adapt to the desires of the parties;


> 2. If the Tribunal is a disagreeable forum, there would be alternatives.


> Note that national security may be a defence to jurisdiction or disclosure or co-operation, though it is not mentioned further in this draft. See e.g. Article 72 of the ICC treaty.


> The Treaty or Rules should explicitly note those cases where an issue is outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.

1. State Parties consent by way of this treaty to grant exclusive jurisdiction over disputes between a Debtor and Creditors of the Debtor;


2. The Tribunal shall be a permanent institution and shall have the powers to exercise its jurisdiction over persons and Member States where an application has been made to the Tribunal pursuant to this Treaty.


> The above is based on ICC Article 1. The role of the application in relation to jurisdiction may be that the application confers upon the tribunal the consent of the debtor to waive its immunity as a sovereign.


> The jurisdiction above binds Member States to awards of the body. The conferral of authority occurs at the signing (or ratification) of this treaty. That conferral extends to all persons who are subjects of a Member State.


> There are a number of related jurisdictional questions, namely in rem and remedial jurisdiction, that may warrant further discussion.


3. Creditors are deemed to consent and thereby attourn to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal where they file proof of claim, or they do not bring a motion before the Tribunal to declare the jurisdiction of the Tribunal ultra vires over their claims within the time prescribed by the Rules.


> The above clause binds creditors who are not nationals of parties to this treaty.


> Jurisdiction should be determined early and definitively. This is a balancing of the unfairness that occurs by binding individuals to a process that does not adequately protect their interests against the overall benefit of an expedient process that cannot be derailed by jurisdictional challenges.


> There doesn’t appear to be a precedent for statutory attournment in treaties. It is important because jurisdictional disputes can be notoriously lengthy, and in insolvency that delay creates wastage.


Competence-Competence
---------------------


1. The Tribunal shall be the sole Judge of its own competence.


> This is from ICSID article 41, though this goes further by stating that the Tribunal will be the “sole Judge” of its own competence.


2. Any motion that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to determine a dispute shall be considered by the Tribunal, which shall determine whether to deal with it as a preliminary question or join it to the merits of the dispute.


> The above is from ICSID article 41(2).


> Several factors weigh into this clause. Pragmatics are at the forefront - too many motions would deny the ability of the Tribunal to provide a service. This ought to be weighted against considerations for minority creditors whose rights may be trampled by the majority. Abuse of process is also a concern.


Applicable law
--------------


1. The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with international law, the law governing the Debt and the rules set out in the Model Rules and the Declaration Instructions applicable to the debtor state, if any.


> The above is from article 42(1) of the ICSID treaty.


2. The provisions of paragraphs(1) and (2) shall not prejudice the power of the Tribunal to decide a dispute ex aequo et bono if the parties so agree.


3. The Tribunal may not bring in a finding non liquet on the ground of silence or obscurity of the law.


> The above is from article 42(2) of the ICSID treaty, and similar to Article 4 of the French civil code (‘refus de juger’).


Disclosure and discovery
------------------------


> The symmetry of information available to the tribunal and participants  is one of the most prominent facilitators of negotiated settlement. Parties informed of the facts and the legal expectations flowing therefrom are inclined, in the presence of participants appearing to act in good faith, to negotiate a resolution so as to avoid wastage due to delay.


> The Treaty sets out the powers through the Administration section to create Rules related to disclosure and discovery.


1. The Tribunal shall have powers to make requests of states and Creditors for disclosure of documents and appearance of witnesses for discovery.


> The Tribunal requires the co-operation of States’ authorities to enforce decisions.


2. If a State is requested by the Tribunal to provide a document or information in its custody, possession or control, which was disclosed to it in confidence by a State, intergovernmental organization or international organization, it shall seek the consent of the originator to disclose that document or information. If the originator is a State Party, it shall either consent to disclosure of the information or document or undertake to resolve the issue of disclosure with the Tribunal.


> Clause 2 above  comes from Article 73 of the ICC, with some tweaking as the the ICC provision is more appropriate to international criminal proceedings.


> The above is more appropriate for a criminal proceeding. A civil analogy ought to be used in its place, and notably deference to the Rules so that discovery and disclosure obligations may be adapted over time.


3. Authorities of States Parties shall make best efforts to comply with requests by the Tribunal. Where a request cannot be fulfilled, the Authorities shall explain the reason that the request could not be complied with.


> The above should probably defer more precise requirements - timing, etc. - to the Rules.
