
Rules and Procedures
====================


> The Tribunal shall have a set of rules and procedures that govern the process of advancing the dispute.


Declaration
-----------


A State shall commence the procedure set out in this Treaty by filing with the Tribunal an Declaration pursuant to the Rules.


> State financial administration shall be started with an application.


> There is an argument for discussion about whether creditors ought to be able to commence administration.


Rules of procedure
------------------


> TODO: Incorporate eg ICSID Rules of Procedure or ICC Rules of Procedure & Evidence or WTO Understanding on rules and procedures governing the settlement of disputes.


> As a class procedure, there have to be mechanisms for class representation and consensual binding. The two most common alternatives for class representation are: Representative party who has a contractual obligation, fiduciary duty or duty of uberrima fides to members of the class it represents, and democratic vote. The prior is more efficient but may result in decisions that non-representative creditors feel is unfair. The latter requires voting procedures. In the absence of a representative party, most class disputes become “lawyer-driven”, where an elected lawyer becomes the channel for options, recommendations and choices.


> The balance might be a mix of democratic vote for important decisions, with a representative making strategic decisions about positions, participating directly in discoveries, etc.


> The question of how disputes are resolved as between creditors is a matter for some debate..


> How much leeway should be given to creditors taking different positions - Should similarly situated creditors be entitled to take difference positions? Insofar as it advances the resolution (eg by a significant portion of creditors wish to consent to an agreement), it is probably worthwhile.


Standing
--------


> As a class proceeding and financial administration regime, efficiency is of paramount concern. One way to make the process more efficient is to restrict the standing (i.e. who may raise issues before the tribunal).


1. The following shall be granted a right to make submissions to the Tribunal, which submissions shall be heard by the Tribunal in coming to any Judgment:


    a. The Debtor State;


    b. A Creditor representing more than 1/3rd of the value of a class of creditors;


    b. A Creditor Committee representing more than 1/3rd of the value of a class of creditors;


    c. A Creditor who has been granted by the Monitor consent to have standing;


> The Monitor may be a gatekeeper to weed out submissions that are frivolous, vexatious, or lack merit - and to prevent a deluge of repetitive submissions.


    d. The Monitor.


> Shall the Court grant standing to any intervenors, such as experts or affected parties? On the one hand, intervenors reduce dissent by including dissenting parties in the discourse, however permitting intervenors can also significantly increase the number of submissions that must be heard and resulting delays.


2. Any party with standing may:


    a. Make submissions in accordance with the Rules;


    b. Call witnesses to a Hearing, the outcome of which Hearing may materially affect their claims.


> Another possibility is to have a single judge rule on submissions, with appeal to the Tribunal.


> TODO: Rules on forming Creditor Committees; Rules of Creditor Voting; Rules on Creditor Classes.


3. Any party may, except where they have a creditor conflict:


    a. Review documents produced through the disclosure process;


    b. Review transcripts of evidence.
