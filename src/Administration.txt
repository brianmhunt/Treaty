> * Voted on by judges


> * Quorum


> * Assembly - See eg part xi of the ICC

1. The committee known as the “Judicial Council” is constituted.


2. The Judicial Council shall be composed of:


    a. The Chief Judge;


    b. A representative of every Member State


3. The Chief Judge shall preside over the Judicial Council, but if the Chief Judge is absent or so requests, another Judge designed by the Chief Judge shall preside.


4. Members of the Judicial Council other than the Chief Judge shall be appointed by the states.


5. Two-thirds of the members of the Judicial council shall constitute a quorum, and a vote by 2/3rds or more of the quorum shall give effect to the subject matter being voted upon.


6. Members of the Judicial Council may participate by electing a proxy or electronically.


7. The Function of the Judicial Council is:


    a. to consider and vote upon the applicable Rules of the Tribunal;


    b. relevant policies and procedures; and


    c. promotion of the better administration of justice and effective use of resources.


> Given the size of this plenary body, it might be better to have a general framework of Rules of Procedure with a delegation of authority to the Tribunal to adopt and amend its Rule Book.


8. The Judicial Council shall convene annually for a general convention or at a special convention at such time and place as set out in the Rules.


> There are various models for funding such as the state contributions towards the UN, IMF and World Bank, or fees for services such as ICSID filing fees, and specialized  fees for creditor standing to raise distinguishing issues on motions.


> If the Tribunal were constituted by way of amendments to the articles of the IMF or UN, then funding could flow through those institutions.


> The principle behind the funding of the Tribunal is to either base it upon pledges by states or fees for usage.


> The Tribunal could also be funded by specific-purpose pledges, though the nature of the Tribunal is not conducive to this method of funding.


> The Tribunal could also be funded by receiving a percentage of the debts in issue, though this would be an intrinsic conflict of interest.


> The method for funding is a political consideration.
